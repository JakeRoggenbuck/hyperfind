## Why

I still use dmenu and I used to use [rofi](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/dotfiles/tree/main/rofi). I just want something that does Desktop apps and shows the icons. I also want something I can later add a vector search to. I want something that doesn't need to be configured, and that's opinionated and set up how I want by default. 

## Future

I will add some stuff that makes my computer use easier. Not sure what that will be right now.
